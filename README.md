## About ML Zoomcamp

Build and deploy machine learning systems. Focus on training the models to get them to work in production.

- Core ML algorithms and when to use them
- Scikit-Learn and XGBoost
- Preparing data, feature engineering
- Model evaluation and selection
- Deploying models with FastAPI, uv, Docker, and cloud platforms
- Using Kubernetes for ML model serving
- Deep learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow

## Projects

[Capstone Project](projects/)

1. **Complete 2 out of 3 projects**:

    Choose a problem, find a dataset, and develop model. Deploy model into a web service (local deployment or cloud deployment for bonus points).

    - **Midterm Project**: Choose a problem, find a dataset, and develop model
    - **Capstone Project**: includes deploying a model as a web service

2. **Review 3 peers' projects** by the deadline
