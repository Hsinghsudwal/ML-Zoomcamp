## About ML Zoomcamp

Build and deploy machine learning systems. Focus on training the models to get them to work in production.

- Core ML algorithms and when to use them
- Scikit-Learn and XGBoost
- Preparing data, feature engineering
- Model evaluation and selection
- Deploying models with FastAPI, uv, Docker, and cloud platforms
- Using Kubernetes for ML model serving
- Deep learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow
