## About ML Zoomcamp

Build and deploy machine learning systems. Focus on training the models to get them to work in production.

- Core ML algorithms and when to use them
- Scikit-Learn and XGBoost
- Preparing data, feature engineering
- Model evaluation and selection
- Deploying models with FastAPI, uv, Docker, and cloud platforms
- Using Kubernetes for ML model serving
- Deep learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow

## Modules

[**1. Introduction to Machine Learning**](01-intro/)

Learn the fundamentals: what ML is, when to use it, and how to approach ML problems using the CRISP-DM framework.

**Topics:**
- ML vs rule-based systems
- Supervised learning basics
- CRISP-DM methodology
- Model selection concepts
- Environment setup

* [Homework.md](01-intro/homework.md)
* [Homework.ipynb](01-intro/homework_01.ipynb)


[**Module 2: Machine Learning for Regression**](02-regression/)

Build a car price prediction model while learning linear regression, feature engineering, and regularization.

**Topics:**
- Linear regression (from scratch and with scikit-learn)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Regularization techniques
- Model validation

## Projects

[Capstone Project](projects/)

1. **Complete 2 out of 3 projects**:

    Choose a problem, find a dataset, and develop model. Deploy model into a web service (local deployment or cloud deployment for bonus points).

    - **Midterm Project**: Choose a problem, find a dataset, and develop model
    - **Capstone Project**: includes deploying a model as a web service

2. **Review 3 peers' projects** by the deadline
